		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Oats are great as a source of fiber and are relatively easy to cook,
			whether it is in a microwave or on the stovetop. Sweet or savory; they are
			incredibly versatile and oatmeal can be garnished with a variety of
			toppings of our liking.
		</p>
		<p>
			Oatmeal is a staple breakfast item which I find can sustain me for a long
			period of time with stable energy levels which makes it a healthier choice
			compared to most cereals.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 cup of oats of your choice</li>
			<li>2 cups of water</li>
			<li>One pinch of salt</li>
			<li>1 banana, sliced</li>
			<li>1 tsp of chia seeds</li>
			<li>1 tbsp of honey</li>
			<li>2 tbsp granola or nuts (optional)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps (Saucepan)</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring the water to a boil.</li>
			<li>
				Add salt, oats, and chia seeds when water is at a boil. Stir frequently
				to prevent the oats from burning. Note: Please be careful of splatters
				when the oats are cooking. Reduce heat to medium or medium low, if
				needed.
			</li>
			<li>
				When the oats are fully cooked, place into a bowl. Add 1 tbsp of honey
				and mix. Top with the sliced banana.
			</li>
			<li>optional: Add granola or nuts for a bit of crunch.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			I hope you enjoy this recipe. This is a very simple recipe and you can
			spice it up by adding chocolate chips or any other fruits of your choice
			as toppings. Some fruits that I would recommend are strawberries and
			blueberries. I sometimes also add some oatmilk to make it creamier.
